Here are my summaries of and responses to readings in David Chalmers’ anthology
*Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings*. I’m reading the book
to become familiar with the field, and this post will serve as a log.

1. *Meditations on First Philosophy* (II & VI), René Descartes

   Everything can be doubted—an omnipotent being might be manipulating my
   senses—except my being, since I who make this statement must exist. Objects
   are better understood by the intellect than through the senses. Therefore, I
   can achieve better perception of my own mind than of anything else. My senses
   depend on bodies distinct from me which produce sensations for me since
   perception is clearer than what I can think of on my own, and since I
   perceive things without my consent. My body is distinct from my mind, yet
   they are intimately intermingled. God can create everything that I can
   understand clearly and distinctly. God has transmitted these ideas to me, and
   God is not a deceiver, so I can be sure that I am not mistaken when I check
   my conclusions using every means granted to me.

2. *Passions of the Soul* (excerpt), René Descartes
3. “On the Hypothesis That Animals Are Automata, and Its History” (excerpt),
   Thomas H. Huxley
4. “An Unfortunate Dualist,” Raymond M. Smullyan

   If dualism (especially epiphenomenalism) is true, then there could be a
   miracle drug that annihilates the mind without changing any aspect of
   behavior. However, if a person, tempted by a miserable life, were to take
   this drug, there would be no visible effects, and they would go on behaving
   as though they are still miserable.

5. “Descartes’ Myth,” Gilbert Ryle

   Ryle describes the view, following Descartes, that the mind is “a ghost in
   the machine,” a fundamentally different kind of substance from the body, and
   the inconveniences that ensue. There would be no evidence for the existence
   of other minds and for how we describe other people’s mental processes. He
   thinks dualism rests on a category mistake that assumes that the mind is an
   entity similar in sort to physical entities.

6. “Psychology in Physical Language,” Rudolf Carnap
7. “Brains and Behavior,” Hilary Putnam
8. “Is Consciousness a Brain Process?” U. T. Place
9. “Sensations and Brain Processes,” J. J. C. Smart

   Smart thinks it is implausible that consciousness operates beyond physical
   laws, but he is not satisfied with behaviorism either. He thus puts forward
   that consciousness is (happens to be) a brain process, just like
   lightning is an electrical discharge. A person can be ignorant of this
   underlying fact and still talk about consciousness the way they do, and this
   theory does not mean that people’s statements about conscious states are
   translatable into statements about brain states. Sentences can be analyzed to
   have neutral implications for metaphysics by adding a phrase like “there is
   something going on which is like what is going on when” when describing
   conscious experience.
