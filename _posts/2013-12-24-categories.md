Here are my summaries and responses to readings in David Chalmers’ anthology
*Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings*.

1. *Meditations on First Philosophy* (II & VI), René Descartes

   Everything can be doubted—an omnipotent being might be manipulating my senses—except
   my being, since I who make this statement must exist. Objects are better
   understood by the intellect than through the senses. I can therefore achieve
   better perception of my own mind than of anything else. My senses depend on
   bodies distinct from me which produce sensations for me—perception is clearer
   than what I can think of on my own, and I perceive things without my consent.
   My body is distinct from my mind, yet they are intimately intermingled.
   God can create everything that I can understand clearly and distinctly. God
   has transmitted these ideas to me, and God is not a deceiver, so I can be sure
   that I am not mistaken when I check my conclusions using every means granted to me.
